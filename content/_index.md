### About me
I began my journey into bioinformatics during my post-doc as a result of needing to analyze my own single cell RNASeq data.  Thanks to the extremely user friendly Seurat tutorials and a few friends trying to learn R at the same time, I was able to venture into the world of bioinformatics.  

As I transitioned from the bench-top to the laptop, I wanted to create this blog for a couple reasons:
1. To help others make the same transition I did.  Learning to code can be hard, especially if you're trying to learn on your own, and I want to help others avoid some of the roadblocks that I hit
2. To provide insights from both my mistakes and successes
3. As a place to share and document my code

I hope you find my posts helpful and please let me know if there are other topics of interest or if you have any questions!  Or feel free to drop a comment, I always welcome constructive feedback!
