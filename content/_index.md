## Welcome to my bioinformatics blog where you can learn with me!


### About me
I began my journey into bioinformatics almost 5 years ago during my post-doc as a result of needing to analyze my own single cell RNASeq data.  Thanks to the extremely user friendly Seurat tutorials and a few friends trying to learn R at the same time, I was able to venture into the world of bioinformatics.  

As I recently(ish) transitioned from the bench-top to the laptop, I wanted to create this blog for a couple reasons:
1. primarily to help others learn and avoid some of the hang-ups where I found myself stuck within the past few years
2. to document my learning journey

I hope you find my posts helpful and please let me know if there are other topics of interest or if you have any questions!    
Additionally, as I am continuing to learn I always welcome constructive feedback
