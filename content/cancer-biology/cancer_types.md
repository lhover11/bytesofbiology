### Cancer Biology Basics
#### Classification of Tumors

Cancers are classified by: the type of tissue the cancer originated from AND the primary site (where the cancer first developed)

#### Classification by Tissue Type:
6 major categories:
Carcinoma, Sarcoma, Myeloma, Leukemia, Lymphoma and Mixed Types

**Carcinoma**: Malignant transformation of epithelial cells (internal or external lining of the body)
80-90% of all cancers
Epithelial Tissue derived from: ectoderm, endoderm or mesoderm
Examples of epithelial tissue: skin, gastrointestinal tract

2 Major subtypes of carcinomas:
Adenocarcinoma: tumors from an organ or a gland
example: lung adenocarcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma: tumors from squamous epithelium
example: Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma - skin cancer

Most carcinomas affect organs or glands that are capable of secretion such as lung, colon, prostate, bladder and breast

**Sarcoma**: Malignant transformation of mesenchymal or connective tissue
Mesenchymal tissue derived from mesoderm
ex: Fibroblasts, adipocytes, cartilage, bone, muscle
Sarcomas typically develop in young adults
Examples: osteosarcoma (bone), chondrosarcoma (cartilage)

**Myeloma**: cancer originating from plasma cells of bone marrow

**Leukemia**: cancers of bone marrow ("blood cancers")
note: leukemia means white blood in Greek

**Lymphoma**: cancer in the glands or nodes of the lymphatic system
These are solid cancers unlike leukemias
examples: Hodgkin lymphoma adn Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

**Mixed Types**: can be mixes of the types above such as
adenosquamous carcinoma
mixed mesodermal tumors


Stage vs Grade
Stage = Attempt to assess where the tumor is in terms of its sites and involvement
(primary site vs metastatic)

Grade = attempt to assess aggressiveness of the tumor and how differentiated it is
1 = well differentiated/least aggressive 4 = poorly differentiated/most aggressive
