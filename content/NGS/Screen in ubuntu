
I want to be able to use screen so I don't lose any work

# Install screen
sudo apt install screen

 But now when I try to run screen -S index (trying to name my session) I get the error:
 Cannot make directory '/run/screen': Permission denied

 Thankfully host4geeks.com had a whole blog about this:
 https://host4geeks.com/blog/how-to-fix-cannot-make-directory-run-screen-permission-denied/

First check the ownership and permissions of /run:
ls -ld /run
# drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 140 Mar 13 08:34 /run

This shows the root has read/write/execute rights, but the user lacks write permissions (-xr-) so this is why we can't create a subdirectory here

We can give user account write access with:
sudo chmod 777 /run

Then let's try it again
screen -S index
**SUCCESS**
