I'm a firm believer that sometimes you just need to change the colors in Rstudio to get through the day  
I was so excited when I first found out about chaning the RStudio theme and I think it's something that isn't shown to people learning R enough, it can give you the "umph" you need to get through the rest of your coding project

Step 1: Use a theme already available in Rstudio:  

In RStudio go to -- **Tools** --> **Global Options**

Then click **Appearance**
