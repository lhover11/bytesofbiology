Always always QC your code and your output files.  My general rule for myself is that I expect to find an error in my result files.  If something appears to work perfectly the first time you run it **beware**!! 

2. Try out your new functions, code, plots, etc on small subsets of your data
Don't waste lots of time trying to run your new cool function on a huge dataset.  Practice it on a handful of values and see if it outputs what you're expecting

3. For me, programming wasn't exciting until I was working on something I cared about
I took lots of courses, but the information didn't really stick until I was working on projects and figuring out how to generate specific outputs
For example, when starting out, copy the code for a simple plot and then figure out how to change the color to a color that you really like.  Then you can see an output that you generated, that's when it gets fun.  You did that!  

3. ChatGPT is your friend, but is a friend that occasionally lies (or maybe like a friend that's just overly confident)
Always check the code output by ChatGPT/other AI tools
ChatGPT can be a lot of help to figure out
