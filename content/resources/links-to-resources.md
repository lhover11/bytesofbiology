Below I've included links that I've found to be really useful as I learn bioinformatics and coding  
I will continue to update this page as I continue learning


### Courses
[Datacamp:](https://www.datacamp.com/)
You do have to pay for a subscription, but this is where I learned to code in R first

[Biostar Handbook:](https://www.biostarhandbook.com/)
This has been an extremely useful book with a corresponding course that gives a great explanations of many key topics for bioinformatics including file types, accessing data, alignment, and downstream analysis including RNAseq and chIP-seq.  I would highly recommend checking this 

[STAT115](https://www.youtube.com/@xiaoleshirleyliu6474/playlists)
Dr. Liu uploaded her STAT115 course at Harvard to youtube which is another great way to learn about bioinformatics

[Stats with Dr. Irizarry](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/pages/teaching.html)
There are many different stats/data science courses available here that have a free audit option



### Blogs and Videos
[Ming Tommy Tang](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/)

[Bioinformagician](https://bioinformagician.org/index.html)

[Dave Tang:](https://davetang.org/muse/)
I used Dave Tang's post about creatng a heatmap with pheatmap countless times when I was starting out

[StatQuest:](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)
I check out StatQuest videos all the time!  He gives super clear explanations of many statistical analyses. BAM!!
